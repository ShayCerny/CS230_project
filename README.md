# Draw It or Lose It - Software Design Documentation

## Overview

The Gaming Room is a client that currently has an Android-based game application called Draw It or Lose It. This game is inspired by the classic Win, Lose or Draw television game show. Instead of players drawing images themselves, the application renders images from a preloaded library as clues. The game consists of four one-minute rounds, with drawings fully appearing at the 30-second mark. If a team fails to guess the puzzle in time, other teams can attempt to solve it within a 15-second window.

The Gaming Room seeks to expand Draw It or Lose It to multiple platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile devices, within a distributed environment. Our task as consultants at Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) is to evaluate these platforms and assess how the game can be deployed efficiently.

# Software Design Documentation

## Strengths in Documentation Development

One of the key strengths in developing this documentation was ensuring clarity and thoroughness in evaluating each platform’s capabilities. The document effectively details the advantages and limitations of Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile platforms in relation to Draw It or Lose It's needs. Additionally, it provides insights into deployment considerations, ensuring that the client has a well-informed basis for making a decision.

## Value of the Design Document Process

The process of working through the software design document helped in structuring the game’s expansion strategy. By systematically analyzing platform-specific characteristics, we gained a deeper understanding of technical requirements and potential challenges. This made it easier to plan an efficient and scalable solution for multi-platform deployment.

## Potential Revisions and Improvements

If one section were to be revised, it would be the analysis of mobile platforms. Given the rapid evolution of mobile technology, additional research into cross-platform development frameworks such as Flutter or React Native could be beneficial. Expanding on cloud-based deployment strategies for mobile and desktop compatibility would also enhance the document.

## User Needs and Software Design Implementation

User needs were interpreted by considering accessibility, performance, and usability across various platforms. Since Draw It or Lose It relies on real-time rendering and team-based interactions, designing for minimal latency and smooth cross-platform gameplay was a priority. Addressing user experience in different environments ensures a seamless gaming experience regardless of the chosen platform.

## Software Design Approach and Future Strategies

The software design approach involved evaluating platform-specific requirements, exploring cross-platform frameworks, and considering cloud-based solutions for scalability. Moving forward, similar software applications should incorporate:

- A modular architecture for easier adaptability across platforms.

- Cloud-based services for synchronization and game data management.

- Cross-platform development frameworks to reduce redundant development efforts.

- Performance testing tailored to each platform to optimize user experience.

By following these strategies, The Gaming Room can ensure that Draw It or Lose It successfully transitions from a single-platform game to a robust, distributed gaming application accessible to a wider audience.
